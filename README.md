👋 Hi there! I'm Tanishk Bisht, a Software Engineering graduate passionate about building reliable, scalable, and intelligent software systems that solve real-world problems.

🚀 I have hands-on experience across full-stack development, AI-powered systems, test automation, and backend engineering, with a strong interest in building products end-to-end and improving system quality through thoughtful design and automation.

💻 My primary tech stack includes Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, FastAPI, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Docker, along with experience using Git/GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms like AWS.

🤖 During my internship at Architech, I helped build an LLM-powered test automation platform that dynamically generates and executes Playwright test scripts from website content. I worked on backend APIs, frontend features, JIRA integration, CI/CD workflows, and reliability improvements—focusing on making automation faster, smarter, and more scalable.

🧠 I’ve also built AI and NLP projects, including an AI Text Detector and Offensive Speech Detection system, applying techniques such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and API integration using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

🛠️ On the systems side, I’ve developed embedded and IoT projects such as an Automated Plant Irrigation System and an Earthquake Early Warning System, integrating sensors, microcontrollers, serial communication, and real-time data visualization.

🔍 I enjoy working on problems involving system design, APIs, databases, testing, and performance, and I’m especially interested in roles at the intersection of software engineering and AI.

🌟 Known for being curious, proactive, and collaborative, I enjoy learning quickly, taking ownership, and continuously improving both code and processes.
